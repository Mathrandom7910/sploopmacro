#SPLOOPHACK

SploopHack v2, since v1 required windows 64 bit. This *should be able to run on more devices (java required)

If you get banned, not my fault. I do not encourage use cheats/hacks/exploits to gain an advantage on sploop.io. This is simply for educational purposes. You can get a pre-built binary over there (under releases tab) ->

Download jar and double click to run!

Bye .io games

## How to build:

download the zip file in releases, unzip, open command prompt there. Run `./gradlew build`
check the build/libs folder if that wont work just try `gradlew build` in command prompt
